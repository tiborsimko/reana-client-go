## About

REANA-Client-Go is a component of the [REANA](https://www.reana.io/) reusable
and reproducible research data analysis platform. It provides a command-line
tool that allows researchers to submit, run, and manage their computational
workflows.

- seed workspace with input code and data
- run computational workflows on remote compute clouds
- list submitted workflows and enquire about their statuses
- download results of finished workflows

## Usage

The detailed information on how to install and use REANA can be found in
[docs.reana.io](https://docs.reana.io).

### Installation from source

Install the executable into the Go binary directory:

```console
$ make install
```

The destination defaults to the value of `go env GOBIN`, or to
`$(go env GOPATH)/bin` when `GOBIN` is not configured. Make sure that this
directory is present in `PATH`.

Set `BINDIR` to an absolute path to choose a different destination, such as a
Python virtual environment's scripts directory:

```console
$ make install BINDIR=/path/to/virtualenv/bin
```

Use the same destination to remove the executable:

```console
$ make uninstall BINDIR=/path/to/virtualenv/bin
```

### Bundling additional workflow source files

The `create` and `validate` commands upload a scoped specification bundle for
server-side workflow loading. Declare every imported source explicitly under
`workflow.files` or `workflow.directories` so it is available to the loader.

For example, given this Snakemake project:

```text
analysis/
├── reana.yaml
├── Snakefile
└── rules/
    └── common.smk
```

where `Snakefile` contains `include: "rules/common.smk"`, declare the included
source in `reana.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0.9.0
workflow:
  type: snakemake
  file: Snakefile
  directories:
    - rules
```

Paths are relative to the directory containing the selected specification.
Absolute paths, paths that escape through `..`, and symbolic links are rejected.
Use `workflow.files` only for workflow definitions and configuration needed
while loading the workflow; input datasets belong under `inputs.files` or
`inputs.directories`.

Validation snapshots accept at most 1,000 files, 2,000 directories, 100 MiB of
file content, and 64 relative path components. Symbolic links are not followed.

`reana-client-go validate --environments` performs offline image-reference
checks and reports effective runtime identities. Add `--pull` to verify
availability and inspect those images with your local container runtime and
registry credentials; the REANA server does not contact image registries.

## Shell completion

The `reana-client-go` supports shell completion for Bash and Zsh. To enable the
auto-completion of commands and options, add the following to your shell
configuration file:

**Bash** (add to `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
source <(reana-client-go completion bash)
```

**Zsh** (add to `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
source <(reana-client-go completion zsh)
compdef _reana-client-go reana-client-go
```
